# XKCDViewer
This is a very simple Android viewer for the xkcd comics. You can view any existing xkcd comic, mark them as favorites, save them in a list and save the images to your Gallery. This app uses REST, dependency injection with Hilt/Dagger, view binding, data binding, MVVM with a Room database and has a simple unit test.
