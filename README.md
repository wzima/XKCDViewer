# XKCDViewer
This is a very simple Android viewer for the xkcd comics using REST. You can view any existing xkcd comic, mark them as favorites and save them in a list. This app uses dependency injection with Hilt/Dagger, View Binding, Data Binding, MVVM with a Room database and has a simple unit test.
